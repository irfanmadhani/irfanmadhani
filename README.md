ðŸ“ˆ **Projects and Contributions**

I believe in learning by doing, and my GitHub repositories are a reflection of my hands-on approach. Here are some notable projects:

- **Wedding Planner**
  
  Used TypeScript, React.js, HTML5, and CSS to create a fully functioning full-stack wedding planner web app that allows for the saving and accessing of client-created wedding information to a server.

  Features include:
   - Ability to add wedding guests with specified dietary restrictions, familial relationships, and accompanying guests.
   - Ability to view a master list of all attendees and their key information.
   - Ability to view event metrics including the minimum and maximum possible guests, the number of guests from each party's family, and percentage of unrelated guests.
   - Ability to access a customized 'details' page for each guest added to view and edit confirmation of attendance, dietary restrictions, relationships, and number of accompanying guests.
   - Ability to run the wedding planner in sync across multiple tabs.
 

- **Tile Designer**

  Used TypeScript, React.js, HTML5, and CSS to create a graphics-based, full-stack tile designer web app.

  Features include:
  - Ability to access and delete already existing tile designs.
  - Ability to easily create new custom tile designs by splitting & merging squares, and changing individual tile colors.
  - Ability to save client-created tile designs to a server list to be accessed later.
  - Ability to run the tile designer in sync across multiple tabs.

- **Mini Git (Version Control System)**
  
  Utilized Java to create a condensed version-history repository manager with features including formalized addition, deletion, and 
reporting of changes to a repository, as well as the chronological synchronization of multiple repositories.
